# Wazuh Installation & Setup Guide (SOC Lab)

## Overview
Wazuh is an open-source security platform used for **host-based intrusion detection (HIDS)**, **log analysis**, **file integrity monitoring**, **vulnerability detection**, and **SIEM/XDR capabilities**.  
This guide documents the step-by-step installation of a **Wazuh all-in-one deployment** for SOC lab and learning purposes.

## Architecture Used
- **Wazuh Manager**
- **Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch-based)**
- **Wazuh Dashboard**
- All components installed on a **single Ubuntu server**

> This setup mirrors small-to-medium SOC environments and is ideal for labs.
